## Mock Finance Flask app
Made with Python, Sqlite, HTML/CSS, and Html templating done with Jinja

Dependencies to run: You must install the following modules via pip: Flask, Flask-Session, requests, and cs50.
After everything is installed you should be able to just execute `flask run` in the folder of app.py.

To test the app you can create a fake account at the register and explore from there

Implemented all but the login page and all but some of the very basic setup.
